h2. FAQ

Question: How did you arrived at the formula for the step detection?
Answer: It's completely a result of experimentation. I know this is lame, but this was a weekend hack I made just for myself.

Question: How does the step detection algorithm work?
Answer: Basically, it aggregates the sensor values, finds the maximum and minimum, and if the difference is bigger than a value (which depends on the sensitivity setting) then it counts it as a step. There's is some additional optimization, which I arrived to through experimentation.

Question: In some other place, it says it's licensed under GPL, but here it says "No restrictions"; which one is true?
Answer: The one attached to the source code applies, so for this version "No restrictions". Previously it was under GPL, so some forks may still be under GPL.

h2. License

No restrictions. You are free to do anything with the source code.
